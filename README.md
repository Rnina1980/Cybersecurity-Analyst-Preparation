# Cybersecurity-Analyst-Preparation
Cybersecurity Analyst Preparation – EDR • SIEM • SOAR • VM • AI/ML

This repo contains a PowerPoint presentation I created as part of my Master’s in Information Systems program.
The goal of this project was to:

✔ Demonstrate my understanding of modern cybersecurity tools
✔ Teach core concepts related to EDR, SIEM, SOAR, cloud, and vulnerability management
✔ Build a training resource I could present and record through OBS
✔ Prepare technically for upcoming cybersecurity interviews
✔ Document my hands-on lab work and learning progress

The presentation includes high-level explanations, diagrams, workflows, and examples for:

🔹 EDR / CrowdStrike Fundamentals

What an EDR agent is

Detections, incidents, process trees

IOA vs IOC

Real-world attack examples

Common interview questions

🔹 Qualys & Vulnerability Management

Agent-based vs agentless scanning

CVSS, severity, and QIDs

Noise reduction

Dashboards, baselines, and remediation workflow

🔹 Splunk SIEM

Log ingestion

Indexes & sourcetypes

Basic SPL searches

Visualization and detection examples

🔹 SOAR Automation

Playbooks

Incident response automation

Real-world security orchestration scenarios

🔹 AI/ML in Cybersecurity

Evasion, poisoning, prompt manipulation

AI-based anomaly detection

ML in antivirus & EDR

🔹 Cloud Security Overview

IAM

Shared responsibility

Container security

Common cloud threats

🔹 Lab Work

Sysmon → JSON → Splunk ingestion pipeline

Windows and Linux log analysis

Hands-on practice for VM, SIEM, and detection engineering

🎓 Why I Built This

As part of my graduate program and my own career development, I wanted a project that:

Consolidated the skills I’m learning

Helped me teach the material (best way to retain)

Prepared me for cybersecurity analyst interviews

Demonstrated hands-on competence to recruiters and hiring managers

This is both an academic project and part of my cybersecurity learning journey.
